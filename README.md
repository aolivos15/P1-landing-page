# "Corazón de Frutilla" Landing Page

## Description

This is a landing page for a ficticious business called "Corazón de Frutilla", an online store that sells knitting and crocheting supplies. I made this web site as my first project for a full-stack development bootcamp by UDD, Chile. The goal of this project was to practice building responsive websites using HTML and CSS.
